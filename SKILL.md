# Encuadre Production API

Use this skill whenever an agent needs to interact with the Encuadre production portal rather than Firebase directly.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Base URL: `https://prod.encuadre.muxp.art/api`.
- Never connect an agent directly to Firestore, Storage, Clerk Admin APIs, or Firebase Admin SDK. Use the REST API only.
- Never put `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, connection exchange secrets, temporary sessions, or grants in frontend code, prompts, logs, commits, or chat messages.
- Treat contact data, project data, notes, phone numbers, emails, and media references as internal production information.
- Do not invent Firestore paths, fields, roles, or endpoints. Use only the contract in `references/api-reference.md`.
- Do not send arbitrary Firestore documents. Every write must use an explicit endpoint and validated fields.
- Ask for user confirmation before a consequential write when the user has not clearly requested it. A `DELETE` is always soft delete, but still requires recent user authentication.

## Connection flow

There is no API key or environment secret for agents. Before every first API call in a chat, start a connection with `POST /auth/connect` and retain its `requestId` and `exchangeSecret` only in the tool state. Show the returned `authUrl` to the user and wait for their explicit approval through Clerk.

After the user confirms, call `POST /auth/connect/:requestId/exchange` with `X-Connection-Secret`. It returns a temporary `X-Encuadre-Session` that expires server-side after 30 minutes. Use it for all data endpoints. Do not print the exchange secret, session token, or grant in a chat response.

If `exchange` returns `CONNECTION_PENDING`, wait at least the returned two-second interval before trying again. If it returns `CONNECTION_EXPIRED`, `CONNECTION_UNAVAILABLE`, or an API call returns `CONNECTION_REQUIRED`, start a new connection and show its new link. Clerk bearer tokens are accepted only by the web approval routes; never send one from an agent to a data endpoint.

Updates, person associations, photo uploads, and deletes also require a recent authorization grant. Never ask the user to paste any secret into a browser.

## Cloud and ChatGPT mode

This skill is cloud-first. Do not use PowerShell, Firebase CLI, local files, environment variables, or a user-provided API key to access the API.

For a normal ChatGPT cloud conversation, use the remote MCP connector at `https://prod.encuadre.muxp.art/mcp`. It uses OAuth authorization code flow with PKCE. ChatGPT owns the OAuth state and bearer token: the user is redirected to Encuadre, signs in with Clerk, and explicitly approves access. The MCP access token is opaque, server-side validated, and expires after 30 minutes; do not request or create refresh access.

The current MCP connector exposes the read tools `list_projects`, `get_project`, `get_project_context`, `list_contacts`, and `get_contact`. For a workflow that needs writes, use the REST API connection and recent-grant flow described above until a corresponding MCP write tool is explicitly published.

Read `references/cloud-chatgpt.md` before configuring the connector. Never ask the user to paste an OAuth code, PKCE verifier, exchange secret, or session token into chat.

## Standard tool contract

Expose or emulate these agent tools using HTTP calls described in the reference:

- `list_projects(search?, includeArchived?)`
- `get_project(id)`
- `get_project_context(id)`
- `search_contacts(query)`
- `list_contacts(search?)`
- `get_contact(id)`
- `create_project(data)`
- `update_project(id, data)`
- `create_contact(data)`
- `update_contact(id, data)`
- `list_project_people(projectId)`
- `add_person_to_project(projectId, type, person)`
- `update_project_person(projectId, personId, type, updates)`
- `remove_person_from_project(projectId, personId, type)`
- `upload_contact_photo(contactId, contentBase64, mimeType)`
- `delete_project(id)`
- `delete_contact(id)`

Read `references/api-reference.md` before using a tool that writes, deletes, uploads, or handles a new resource type. Read `references/security-and-workflow.md` whenever a request returns `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `INVALID_GRANT`, or involves a destructive/sensitive action.
Read `references/cloud-chatgpt.md` before configuring or using this skill in a ChatGPT cloud conversation.

## Required response behavior

- Preserve the API's structured error fields: `error`, `message`, and any `authUrl`/`expiresAt`.
- If the API returns `CONNECTION_REQUIRED`, start a connection and show the returned `authUrl`; do not attempt an unauthenticated retry.
- If the API returns `AUTH_REQUIRED`, show the user the returned `authUrl`, explain that it is a short-lived Clerk reauthentication link, and wait for the user to complete it before retrying the exact same operation.
- Retry only with the returned `grantId`, never with a guessed, reused, or client-invented grant.
- Report the resulting resource ID and operation outcome, but do not echo credentials or complete tokens.
- If a requested operation is not in the contract, state that it is not currently exposed by the API instead of falling back to direct Firebase access.
